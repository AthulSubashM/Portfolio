            <h2>Loading Page</h2>

           <p>
            The loading screen for the app on all three operating system is designed in a very minimalistic way according to their respective design guidelines. The first mockup is for the Apple iPhone 13 Pro. I got the frame of the device and the progress bar from Figma’s community files. I designed the logo for the app through gimp. The second mockup is for the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the third is for a Windows desktop. All the elements in these two designs were completely made from scratch by referencing the design guidelines. After the loading screen, the app displays the login screen or the status page, depending on weather the user has logged into their account or not.
         </p>
           </div>
     
            <div class="log" id="two">
            <h2>Login Page</h2>
            <img class="ios" src ="IMG/A2/ios2Login.png" alt="">
            <img class="and" src="IMG/A2/and2Login.png" alt="">
            <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win2Login.png" alt="">
            <p>
                The login screens for all mockups were completely designed based on their respective UI, while trying to keep the design consistent across the platforms. I made the sign in button for the iOS app more rounded and glossy, while I gave the interface for Android more of a flat and boxy look, which is consistent with the Material Design. Meanwhile, I added a background and heavily blurred it for the Windows version. I also moved the App logo to the left side and the log in box to the right to utilize the excess space. . If the user does not already have an account, they could click on the Create Account button and go to the Sign-Up page.
             </p>
             
            </div>
            <div class="sgn" id="three">
             <h2>Sign-Up Page</h2>
             <img class="ios" src ="IMG/A2/ios3SignUp.png" alt="">
           <img class="and" src="IMG/A2/and3SignUp.png" alt="">
           <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win3SignUp.png" alt="">
             <p>
                The Sign-Up pages for the iOS and Android app look very similar to their login pages, but with more text fields. Meanwhile for the Windows version, the box is extended to accommodate the extra text fields and logo is shrunken and moved to the top. If the user already has an account, they could click on the Sign In button and return to the login screen.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="cnf" id="four">
                <h2>Confirmation Page</h2>

                <img class="and" src="IMG/A2/and4Confirm.png" alt="">
                <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win4Confirm.png" alt="">
              <p>
                After signing up or signing in, the confirmation page is displayed. If the user’s data is successfully retrieved from the web, they could press the continue/next button to move on to the next page. If it is unsuccessful, the user could press the back button and try signing up or signing in again. In all three design the message is shown in a box with the tick, but I changed the colours on all three platforms to stay consistent with their respective designs.

            <div class="stat" id="five">
            <h2>Status Page</h2>

            <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win5Status.png" alt="">
             <p>
                The status page serves as the front page of the app. Here, the user’s name, date of vaccination and vaccination status is shown along with the QR code. I gave some of the elements in all three pages a green colour so that the user’s vaccination status can be easily identified. In the iOS and Android apps, the button labelled Tracker can be pressed to access the Tracker page and the three dots on the top-right corner can be pressed to access the settings for the app. Meanwhile in the Windows app, the menu button on the top-left can be pressed to expand the side-navigation bar. The side navigation bar also contains the button to go to the Tracker and settings pages.

           <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win6Alert.png" alt="">
             <p>
                This page alerts the user if they have been near a person diagnosed with Covid-19. The design of this page is very similar to the status page. The user can turn off the alert option by click on the toggle button. They can also get help if they are diagnosed with the virus by clicking on the link at the end of the page. In the Windows version, I have shown how the side navigation bar looks like when it is fully expanded. The user can return to the status page by click on the status icon or go to the settings page by clicking on the settings icon.
            </p>

           <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win7Settings.png" alt="">
             <p>
                The settings page contains various options such as to change the language, theme, font size etc. I tried to keep the settings pages very consistent with the settings pages of the three operating systems. The user can return to their previous page by clicking the back button on the iOS and Android versions or by using the side navigation bar on the Windows app. The user can also access the admin page by pressing on the Admin button.
            </p>

           <img class="win" src="IMG/A2/win8Log.png" alt="">
             <p>
                The Admin page displays a list of all the devices the user has been near. It also has some advanced options for developers such as bug reports etc. I gave the Windows version a more detailed log window compared to the mobile versions to utilize the extra space. The user can go back to the settings page by pressing on the back button.
